## üõ°Ô∏è Authentication Methods

SSH supports two types of authentication:

1. **Password-based authentication**
2. **Public key-based authentication** ‚úÖ (Recommended)

Public key authentication is more secure than passwords and is also ideal for automation and scripting.

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Public Key Authentication

- **Security:** No password transmission, making it more secure.
- **Convenience:** No need to type your password every time.
- **Automation:** Ideal for use in scripts and DevOps workflows.
- **Hard to Crack:** Much less vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices for Public Key Authentication

- Never share your **private key** with anyone.
- Use a **passphrase** on your key for added protection.
- Only add **specific public keys** to the `authorized_keys` file.
- **Rotate** your keys regularly.

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup

### üß© Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

- Public Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- Private Key: `~/.ssh/id_rsa`

---

### üì§ Step 2: Copy Public Key to Remote Host

```bash
ssh-copy-id username@remote_ip
```

This command appends your public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server.

---

### üîç Step 3: Test SSH Connection

```bash
ssh username@remote_ip
```

If you log in without being prompted for a password, key-based authentication is successful.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Create SSH Config File

```bash
vim ~/.ssh/config
```

Add the following configuration:

```ini
Host web-server
  HostName 192.168.10.93
  User rubel
  Port 8080
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Here, `web-server` is an alias, allowing you to use `ssh web-server` instead of a full command.

---

### üíª Step 5: Connect Using Host Alias

```bash
ssh web-server
```

Now you no longer need to type: `ssh -p 8080 rubel@192.168.10.93`.

## üèÅ Conclusion

By following this guide, you will be able to:

- Generate an SSH Key Pair
- Configure the Public Key on the remote server
- Use the `.ssh/config` file for simplified connections

This will make your SSH connections more **secure, fast, and convenient**.
